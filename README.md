# JamTogether!

The goal of JamTogether! is to bring musicians together and let them jam!

Our service lets band members pick music to jam on and keeps everyone else's devices
in sync. We will host some sheet music, but we also want to work with other sheet music
providers to share their libraries on this platform so their users can jam.
